University project, aiming to provide a way of managing a warehouse using a web-based app.

The front-end was done using Angular, and the back-end consists of Java(with frameworks such as Spring). Communication between the two is done using a REST API.

All queries are hand-written, as that was a requirement of the task.

The database software used is PostgreSQL.
